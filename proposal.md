Proposal:

For the contractor project I will create a website that lets people create and
interact with countdown clocks. Users will be able to create, name, and interact with
multiple countdown clocks.

This will be useful for creating to-do lists with elements that need to be done or tracked
multiple times. It will also be useful for various tabletop and pen and paper games.
